			<p>To get mining I needed some hardware.. Here's what I used...</p>

				<h3>Motherboard</h3>
					<p>For my rig I decided to go for a Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 SKT-AM3+. The main reason for choosing this motherboard was price, coming in at £103 from Amazon. For that you are getting big bang for your buck. Importantly you get 2 x PCI Express x16 slots running at x16, 2 x PCI Express x16 slots running at x4, and 2 x PCI Express x1. Each of those can be used for for a GPU making a theoretical 6 GPU rig, although after four I'd say you would really start strecthing the MOBO's capabilities. The reason for the AM3+ chipset... well none really, I could have opted for Intel but I thought why not match my AMD Radeon GPU's with an AMD processor. Another being price, AMD processors are typically a lot cheaper than Intel's.
					</p>

			<div class="statement">
				<h3>Memory</h3>
					<p>4GB G.Skill DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz (Ripjaw series) was selected. Mining rigs do not require a lot of system memory as you may think, only enough for the host OS to run comfortably. For Windows you're looking at at least 4GB, for a lightweight Linux distro such as the one I intend on using you could get away with 512MB! The price for 4GB's of this stuff is ridiculously cheap (£37), so why not splurge.
					</p>

			</div>
			<div class="statement">
			<h3>Processor</h3>
				<p>An AMD Sempron 145 AM3 processor was chosen to act as the processor for my rig. At £26 on Amazon its a really sweet deal. Its only job to run the OS, the CPU plays no part in mining and for this reason you really don't need so spend big on something beefy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statement">
			<h3>Power supply</h3>
				<p>Particular attention needs to be given to selecting a power supply, and will likely require that you spend a bit more in this area. Your PSU will need to supply all of the systems hardware with juice including your GPU's.. You will want something that can supply your rig with a reliable steady flow of power and that has the "80 Plus Gold Certified Standard" (voluntary certification program intended to promote efficient energy use in computer power supply units (PSUs). I opted in for the "Corsair AX1200i Professional Series Digital AX 1200i". Its pricey, £254, but it should future proof me if I want to add another GPU to my rig later down the line.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statement">
			<h3>GPU's</h3>
				<p>Three "MSI R9 290x's". This is what I could afford. Spend what you can afford! This is where you want to splash the cash! The GPU's are the only thing that play any part in mining! Period. For this reason, spend as much as you can! At present AMD is king in terms of raw hashing power. Nvidia is behind. Reason being, AMD packs a lot more physical ALU's on chip than Nvidia. See http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/9854/why-do-amds-gpus-mine-faster-than-nvidias for more detail.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statement">
			<h3>PCIe risers</h3>
				<p>Putting three GPU's into an ATX case is not going to happen and if it does the heat they generate (~70-90C) is going to give you some problems. To get around the problem get yourself some PCIe riser cables. These will allow you to position your GPU's outside of the case, thus providing much needed air flow between your cards.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statement">
			<h3>Air flow</h3>
				<p>To aid airflow between my GPU's I bought two 80mm "Be Quite" fans. The reason for these two enhance air flow between the GPU's themselves, see my picture.
