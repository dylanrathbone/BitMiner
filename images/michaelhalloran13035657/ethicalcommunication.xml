		Ethical Communication for the Technical Writer
	</title>
	<paragraph type="ethicsintroduction">
		Ethical communication is “fundamental to responsible thinking, decision making, and the development of relationships and communities within and across contexts, cultures, channels, and media” (NCA Legislative Council 1999). The following guidelines will help you make ethical decisions in your career.
	</paragraph>

			<paragraph type="guidelinesintroduction">

			<paragraph type="content">

			</paragraph>
		<heading2>	
				6: Don’t Mislead Your Readers
		</heading2>	
			<paragraph type="content">
				Avoid “spinning the truth” (Putnam 2004)  Lying by omission is still a lie. These three rules will help prevent from from misleading your reader (Markel 2012): 
					<bullet>
						Only communicate accurate information 
					</bullet>
					<bullet>

					</bullet>

					</bullet>
			</paragraph>
		<heading2>
				7: Avoid Discriminatory Language
			</heading2>
				<paragraph type="content">

				</paragraph>
			<heading2>	
				8: Acknowledge Assistance from Others
			</heading2>
				<paragraph type="content">
					Avoid plagiarism by citing sources and acknowledging collaborators (Markel 2012). 
				</paragraph>
			<heading2>
				9: Be a Responsible Writer
			</heading2>
				<paragraph type="content">
					Ensure clarity and quality in your communication. Do not bury important information in footnotes (Markel 2012). Important information should be easily visible to the reader. Continue your professional development by researching and enacting current best practice.
